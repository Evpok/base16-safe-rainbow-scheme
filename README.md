# base16-safe-rainbow-scheme

A theme for [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16). based on [Summerfruit](https://github.com/cscorley/base16-summerfruit-scheme) and [Paul Tol's technical note for SRON on colourblind-safe colour schemes](https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/data/colourschemes.pdf).

As of now, this implies adding the 8-colour diverging rainbow scheme of the 3.1 version of the aforementioned note and plug it into Summerfruit light and dark shades.
